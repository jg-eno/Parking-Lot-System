                                                        PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Our project titled “Parking Lot System” provides a GUI based system to efficiently allocate parking spaces for different vehicles. We have used a combination of Python and MySQL for the back-end code and
have designed a simple yet robust front-end GUI using Tkinter. For security purposes we have built a simple yet powerful password validation function. Our appropriate pop-up messages for various scenarios 
helps the user understand what they have done to the database. The system runs without any glitches at an optimal speed. This application allows the user to enter his/her registration no to 
allocate his parking space on a particular floor for his/her vehicle and free up the space once he/she picks his vehicle for the next user.

                                                      Features that can be added
• Web-based project –An online web interface can be made available so that all users across could access the same from any part and from any device. 

• Extra Features –The project could be made more usable by including more conditions based on which the parking spaces are to be allotted, and by removing existing restrictions such as allowing the user to
park for a few days, weeks or months

• Security – The project could have been made more secure by including constraints for 
passwords and user name as well
